# Autonomous Drone System

## Overview
This project focuses on building a custom autonomous drone from scratch.
The initial version uses an Arduino-based flight controller. In the next phase, it will be extended with a Raspberry Pi and ROS 2. After that, AI will be added so the drone can operate autonomously without transmitter commands.
