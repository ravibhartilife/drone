# Autonomous Drone System

## Overview
This project focuses on building a custom autonomous drone from scratch.
The initial version uses an Arduino-based flight controller. In the next phase, it will be extended with a Raspberry Pi and ROS 2. After that, AI will be added so the drone can operate autonomously without transmitter commands.

## Project Structure





###########################################################################################################################
I built this drone purely for fun, because I wanted to apply my physics knowledge and technical skills in a real, practical way. That is why I decided to make this drone.

I actually started building this drone at the beginning of my Class 12 during high school. The code works, but it still needs proper PID tuning and more advanced filtering. Because of this, I am now moving toward ROS and the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W.

However, I am not limiting myself to just this. In the coming years, I plan to integrate AI into the drone so it can fly on its own—without any transmitter. It will be able to make decisions independently.

By the way, I am currently in my 2nd semester of college.
